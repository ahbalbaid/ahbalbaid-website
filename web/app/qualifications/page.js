            fundamental algorithms, time and space complexity analysis, and
            optimization techniques. I am skilled in designing efficient
            algorithms for various problem domains, including sorting,
            searching, graph traversal, and dynamic programming.

            In my projects, I have applied algorithmic thinking to solve complex
            problems. For example, in the Embedding Crackers project, I designed
            a topic modeling algorithm that effectively extracted keywords from
            embedded articles using advanced techniques like clustering, neural
            networks, and encode-decode. I am proficient in implementing
            algorithms using programming languages like Python and C++ and have
            a solid grasp of data structures such as arrays, linked lists,
            trees, and graphs. With my strong problem-solving skills and ability
            to design and implement efficient algorithms, I am confident in
            tackling algorithmic challenges and optimizing code for performance.
